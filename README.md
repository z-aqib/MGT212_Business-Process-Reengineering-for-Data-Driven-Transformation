## Weekly Topic Map (from course outline)

This is the official week-wise coverage from the outline:

1. Origins of process thinking (division of labour → industrial process design) 
2. How business processes create value 
3. Efficiency vs. productivity; process performance (throughput, cycle time, cost, waste) 
4. Visualizing processes: process mapping and metrics (flowcharts, swimlanes) 
5. Introduction to BPR: concepts and controversies (Hammer & Champy) 
6. Diagnosing broken processes: tools, Six Sigma, value chains (Fishbone, 5 Whys, Pareto) 
7. Simulating a broken process (group design) 
8. Case: Ford’s accounts payable reengineering 
9. Case: reengineering the engineering process (product development at scale) 
10. Case: GM’s order-to-delivery supply chain BPR 
11. Case: Taco Bell business model reengineering 
12. Field visit to an industrial plant 
13. Digital tools and BPR: process mining using DISCO
