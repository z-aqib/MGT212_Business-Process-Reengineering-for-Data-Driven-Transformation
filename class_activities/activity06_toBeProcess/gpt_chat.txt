for my business process reengeering class we need to evaluate the process of getting a boarding pass, the as-is and to-be, tell me local not international flights
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — let’s go step by step 👇

We’ll do this for domestic (local) flights — for example, within Pakistan (like Karachi → Lahore).

✈️ Process: Getting a Boarding Pass (Domestic Flight)
1. AS-IS Process (Current / Existing Situation)
This describes how most passengers currently get a boarding pass in local airports like Karachi, Lahore, or Islamabad.

Actors Involved
Passenger

Airline check-in staff

Security staff

Airline IT system / Kiosk

Steps
Arrival at airport

Passenger arrives 2 hours before departure.

Finds airline counter.

Security check (initial entry)

Passenger shows CNIC and ticket (printed or on phone).

Enters departure area.

Check-in counter queue

Passenger waits in line for airline counter.

Document verification

Airline staff checks CNIC, flight details, and booking in the system.

Baggage drop

Staff weighs luggage and prints baggage tag.

Boarding pass printing

Staff prints physical boarding pass.

Confirmation

Passenger collects boarding pass and proceeds to security clearance and boarding gate.

Problems / Inefficiencies
Long queues at check-in counters.

Manual verification delays.

Staff dependency for every passenger.

Limited use of technology (self-check-in kiosks underused).

Lost time for passengers with no baggage.

Paper-based boarding passes increase waste.

2. TO-BE Process (Reengineered / Improved Version)
Goal: Reduce waiting time, automate steps, and enhance passenger convenience using digitalization.

New Process Steps
Online check-in (before arriving)

Passenger checks in via mobile app or website (up to 24 hours before flight).

Selects seat and uploads CNIC for verification.

Receives digital boarding pass (QR code).

Arrival at airport

Passenger goes directly to security if no baggage.

If baggage exists → use self-baggage drop kiosk (scan QR + weigh luggage + print tag).

Automated security verification

Security staff scans QR code (digital boarding pass) + CNIC.

System automatically validates flight details.

Proceed to gate

Boarding gate staff rescans QR to verify entry.

Benefits
60–70% reduction in waiting time.

Less congestion at check-in counters.

Paperless (eco-friendly).

Lower staff cost for check-in operations.

Improved passenger experience and accuracy.

3. Quick Comparison Table
Step	AS-IS	TO-BE
Ticket Verification	Manual by staff	Online pre-check with QR
Check-in	At counter	Online or self-kiosk
Boarding Pass	Paper-based	Digital QR code
Baggage Drop	Manual counter	Automated self-drop
Waiting Time	Long queues	Short or none
Staff Involvement	High	Low
Errors	Human-based	System-based (fewer errors)
4. Optional (for diagrams if required)
If you need to show it visually, I can create:

A process flowchart (AS-IS vs TO-BE)

Or a swimlane diagram separating passenger/staff/system activities

Would you like me to make those diagrams for your report or presentation?

AS-IS Process
TO-BE Process


You said:
u need to write a data column to that is needed for each step and make the flowchart in a way that tells what do we do and what do they do
ChatGPT said:
Got it 👍 — you want it structured like a swimlane-style process flow inside Excel, showing:

What the passenger (we) do,

What the airline/staff/system (they) do,

And also a “Data Required” column for each step.

Let’s make it clear, organized, and ready for your BPR submission.

Here’s how the structure will look:

Sheet 1 – AS-IS Process
Step No.	Process Step	We (Passenger) Do	They (Airline/Staff/System) Do	Data Required
1	Arrival at airport	Arrive 2 hrs early, go to counter	—	Flight details, CNIC
2	Security check (entry)	Show CNIC + ticket	Verify ticket and CNIC	CNIC, Ticket
3	Queue for check-in	Wait in line	—	—
4	Document verification	Hand CNIC and ticket	Check booking and flight details	CNIC, Ticket, Booking ref
5	Baggage drop	Give luggage	Weigh luggage, print tag	Luggage info, Passenger ID
6	Boarding pass printing	Collect boarding pass	Print boarding pass	Passenger data, Seat info
7	Proceed to gate	Go to security gate	Check boarding pass	Boarding pass
Sheet 2 – TO-BE Process
Step No.	Process Step	We (Passenger) Do	They (Airline/Staff/System) Do	Data Required
1	Online check-in	Check in via app, upload CNIC	System verifies ID and booking	CNIC, Booking ID
2	Arrival at airport	Arrive near departure time	—	Digital boarding pass
3	Self-baggage drop	Scan QR code, place bag	System weighs and tags luggage	QR code, Bag weight
4	Automated security verification	Show CNIC + QR code	System validates passenger and flight	CNIC, QR code
5	Proceed to gate	Scan QR to enter	Gate system verifies QR	Boarding QR
Would you like me to now generate the updated Excel file with this exact structure and the “We/They/Data Required” columns for both AS-IS and TO-BE sheets?
Once you confirm, I’ll make and give you the new download link.

AS-IS Process
TO-BE Process


You said:
ok we only had to do as -is and now we will do to-be, desgin such a process that theres an agent at the counter and a process that now takes the shortest possible time (my group discussed that the baggage step passenger does on their own)(now u give more)
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — since your group decided that in the to-be process the passenger handles baggage on their own, we can now reengineer the process to make it much faster, while still having an agent at the counter (for minimal support, not full check-in).

Let’s design a smart, optimized domestic flight boarding-pass process that minimizes passenger waiting time but keeps a realistic human touch.

✈️ TO-BE Process: Fast Boarding Pass Generation for Domestic Flights
🎯 Goal
To reduce total check-in and boarding-pass generation time from ~20 minutes to under 5 minutes by automating passenger tasks, digitizing verification, and reducing staff dependency.

Actors
Passenger

Check-in Agent (minimal role)

System / Kiosk

Process Flow (TO-BE)
Step No.	Process Step	We (Passenger) Do	They (Agent/System) Do	Data Required
1	Online Pre-Check (Before Airport)	Use airline app/website to check in, select seat, and upload CNIC	System validates CNIC and booking	CNIC, Booking ID
2	Arrival at Airport	Arrive 45–60 mins before flight; go straight to self-service zone	—	Digital boarding pass (QR code)
3	Self-Baggage Drop	Scan QR code, weigh bag, attach printed tag	System auto-links baggage tag with passenger ID	QR code, Bag weight
4	Quick Assistance Counter (Agent)	Only go to counter if issue occurs (optional)	Agent resolves booking or baggage issues	CNIC, Booking ID
5	Automated Security Check	Show CNIC + scan QR	System validates identity and boarding info	CNIC, QR code
6	Proceed to Boarding Gate	Scan QR code at gate	Gate system auto-verifies passenger entry	Boarding QR
🧩 Key Changes from AS-IS
Area	AS-IS	TO-BE
Check-in	Manual at counter	Online / app-based
Baggage Drop	Done by staff	Done by passenger using self-drop kiosk
Boarding Pass	Printed paper	Digital QR (optional print)
Staff Role	Full-time check-in and luggage handling	Only for assistance or exceptions
Verification	Manual CNIC check	Automated digital scan
Average Time	15–20 minutes	4–5 minutes
💡 New Process Features (You Can Mention in Class)
Hybrid human + automation model — staff only assist, not handle each passenger.

Self-baggage drop kiosks for domestic passengers (reduces bottleneck).

One-stop QR verification — same QR code works for baggage, security, and boarding.

Paperless system — optional boarding pass print for traditional passengers.

Integrated mobile notification — updates when baggage is tagged successfully.

🕒 Expected Outcome
70–80% time reduction in check-in and boarding-pass collection.

Higher accuracy, no human entry errors.

Shorter queues and faster movement through airport.

More satisfied passengers and reduced staff workload.

Would you like me to now make this new TO-BE process in Excel (matching your AS-IS sheet format — “We Do / They Do / Data Required”) so you can directly attach it to your report?

You said:
now but how can we ensure this does security check proeprly, i think that should still be w an agent
ChatGPT said:
Excellent point 👏 — you’re absolutely right to question that.

Even in a highly streamlined to-be design, security verification must stay under human supervision for safety and regulatory reasons. Airports can’t fully automate that step because of ID fraud, prohibited items, and manual judgment needed during checks.

So, let’s refine the TO-BE process to keep security handled by an agent, while everything else stays automated and quick.

✈️ Refined TO-BE Process (Domestic Flights — Fast, but Secure)
🎯 Goal
Keep the process as short as possible without compromising security — so the only fully human-dependent step is the security check.

Actors
Passenger

Check-in Agent (for assistance only)

Security Officer (mandatory step)

System / Kiosk

Process Flow
Step No.	Process Step	We (Passenger) Do	They (Agent/System) Do	Data Required
1	Online Check-In (Before Airport)	Check in via mobile/web, upload CNIC, select seat	System verifies CNIC, booking, and issues digital boarding pass (QR code)	CNIC, Booking ID
2	Arrival at Airport	Arrive ~1 hour before flight, go directly to self-baggage area	—	Digital boarding pass
3	Self-Baggage Drop	Scan QR code, place luggage on scale, attach printed tag	System links tag with passenger and updates baggage database	QR code, Bag weight
4	Assistance Counter (Optional)	Visit only if kiosk error or special case	Agent resolves technical issues	CNIC, Booking ref
5	Security Check (Mandatory — With Agent)	Present CNIC and digital boarding pass; undergo physical + luggage screening	Security officer verifies identity, inspects items, and stamps clearance	CNIC, Boarding QR
6	Proceed to Gate	Walk to gate, scan QR to board	Gate system validates and logs passenger boarding	Boarding QR
Key Notes
✅ Security check remains manual.
The officer must physically verify identity and inspect belongings.

⚙️ Automation is everywhere else: check-in, baggage tagging, boarding validation.

🧾 Minimal agent workload: only troubleshooting and passenger exceptions.

🧍‍♀️ Passenger control: passengers perform most non-security steps themselves.

🔐 Security step is the only queue — but still faster due to reduced congestion at earlier steps.

Expected Outcome
Metric	AS-IS	Refined TO-BE
Check-in time	10–15 min	1–2 min (mostly online)
Baggage handling	Manual	Self-service
Security check	Manual	Still manual (same time)
Total process time	~20–25 min	~7–10 min
Staff requirement	High	Moderate (security + minimal assistance)
Would you like me to make this refined version into the Excel sheet (matching the same layout as your AS-IS file)?
That way you’ll have one consistent file with both “AS-IS” and the realistic TO-BE (fast + secure) process.

when we are hoping to rduce interaction bw pssenger and agent, what is the merit function we are trying to optimize?
ChatGPT said:
Excellent question — and that’s exactly the kind of analytical thinking your Business Process Reengineering (BPR) instructor is looking for 👏

When you say “we are hoping to reduce interaction between passenger and agent,” you’re essentially trying to optimize a merit function that represents process performance — that is, how efficiently and effectively the system operates.

🎯 Merit Function (Objective Function)
In this context, the merit function you’re optimizing can be expressed conceptually as:

Minimize: 
f
=
Total Passenger Processing Time
+
Human Interaction Cost
Minimize: f=Total Passenger Processing Time+Human Interaction Cost
or more broadly:

f
=
w
1
(
T
)
+
w
2
(
C
)
+
w
3
(
E
)
f=w 
1
​
 (T)+w 
2
​
 (C)+w 
3
​
 (E)
Where:

T
T = Average time per passenger (waiting + processing)

C
C = Operational cost (staff, counters, manual steps)

E
E = Error / dissatisfaction rate (human mistakes, miscommunication, stress)

w
1
,
w
2
,
w
3
w

​
 ,w 
2
​
 ,w 
3
​
  = relative importance (weights) based on airport or airline priorities

🧩 What You’re Trying to Optimize
Goal	Explanation	Metric
⏱ Reduce process time	Shorter queues and faster movement through check-in and boarding	Average time per passenger
💰 Reduce staff cost	Fewer agents needed → lower salary + training cost	Staff cost per passenger
🧠 Reduce cognitive/communication load	Less back-and-forth between passenger and staff	Interaction count or touchpoints
✅ Maintain security and accuracy	No compromise on verification	Error rate or security compliance
🙂 Improve passenger experience	Less stress, smoother flow	Satisfaction score or NPS
✈️ So Conceptually:
You’re optimizing something like:

Minimize 
f
=
(
waiting time
+
manual steps
+
staff cost
)
Minimize f=(waiting time+manual steps+staff cost)
subject to

security accuracy ≥ required threshold.
security accuracy ≥ required threshold.
💡 In Plain Words
You’re not just making it faster — you’re optimizing the overall system efficiency by minimizing time and cost without compromising security or reliability.

If you want, I can help you formally write this merit function in a short paragraph suitable for your BPR report (something like: “In our reengineered process, the merit function aims to minimize total passenger processing time and staff involvement while maintaining regulatory security compliance”).

Would you like me to write that formal version?
